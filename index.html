             <p> Hi, I'm Divyansh Pratap Singh, a native Android developer based in Pune, India. I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Engineering from Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering.
            </p>
                <p>  I have a passion for coding and I love developing applications that provide great user experiences.
                    <br> I have experience working with both web development and Android development, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
            </p>       <p>
              When I'm not coding, you can find me indulged in my hobbies which includes reading books, writing diary, walking, and swimming. 
              <br> These hobbies keep me refreshed and motivated, allowing me to bring new and creative ideas to my projects.
              
               </p>      
            </div>
          </section>

          <script>
            // About Me Section Animation
const aboutMe = document.querySelector('#about-me');

window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  const aboutMePosition = aboutMe.getBoundingClientRect().top;
  const screenPosition = window.innerHeight / 1.2;

  if (aboutMePosition < screenPosition) {
    aboutMe.classList.add('about-me-appear');
  }
});
